Northern Railway.... In pursuit of excellence</b></h2>
<p class="main"><b>" After all, what other experiences do we have to compare with travel as opportunities to expand our horizons (geographically, culturally, emotionally, intellectually) to encounter people, cultures and places so different from ourselves?" This is what Mick smith and Rosaleen Duffy conclude in their analyses of Contemporary Geographies of Leisure, Tourism and Mobility. The efficacy of travel can never be over-stated and undertaking travel in the current times is increasingly becoming effortless thanks to the commitment and Zeal on the part of Railways, owing to their improved and widespread network.

Northern Railway, the Jewel Set in the Crown of Indian Railways, has embarked on the mission to vanquish distances and create its own metaphor of existence. Formally established in the year 1952, it remains the largest zone in terms of route Kilometers, even after the re-organization of the Indian Railways into 16 zones. Northern Railway now comprises of 5 Divisions-Ambala, Delhi, Ferozpur, Lucknow and Moradabad.

Reach of Northern Railway

Spreading across the states of Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and the Union Territory of Chandigarh, Northern Railway seems to have the vantage point of standing atop the peninsula and transposing its work rhythms to the rest of the country.                                         

Get-aways on Northern Railway

Every land of India has its unique tale to narrate. Here are some special locations where one experiences the uniqueness of India, where one marvels at the cultural mosaic that is India. The terrain that falls in Northern Railway is also varied, from the mountainous Shivalik range to the lush Tarai region and the majestic Gangetic plains. The North of the country is bordered by the mighty Himalayas, the highest mountains on the earth. The Himalayas are not a single mountain but a series of ranges with beautiful valleys wedged between them. The final Southern range of the Himalayas, the Shivalik Hills ends abruptly in the northern plains of India. In complete contrast to the soaring mountain peaks, the northern plain is oppressively flat and slopes so gradually that almost all the way from Delhi to the Bay of Bengal it slopes only 200M.</p>
<h3 class="main"><b>Lucknow</b></h3>

<p class="main">The Capital of Uttar Pradesh was the Center of the Nawabs for Avadh, who were great patrons of art specially of dance and music. The city's reputation of culture exists even today of nostalgic Kathak dancing and ghazal recitals. They say time zones in Lucknow merges - sifting the present from the pasr could be quite elusive. It's also famous for seeing the Shia Muheram celebrations. Lucknow is also very famous for rich Mughlai cuisine and the attar (perfume of rose). The thread-embroidered chikankari garments of Lucknow continue to be prized item of many a designer's wardrobe. Lucknow has two major Railway stations- the Charbagh and the Lucknow Jn.</b></p>
